      "detailed_description": "<h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong>Purchasing this property with A lifetime lease</strong></h3><br>This property is offered at a reduced price for people aged over 60 through Homewise´s Home for Life Plan. Through the Home for Life Plan, anyone aged over sixty can purchase a lifetime lease on this property which discounts the price from its full market value. The size of the discount you are entitled to depends on your age, personal circumstances and property criteria and could be anywhere between 8.5% and 59% from the property´s full market value. The above price is for guidance only. It is based on our average discount and would be the estimated price payable by a 69-year-old single male. As such, the price you would pay could be higher or lower than this figure.<br><br>For more information or a personalised quote, just give us a call. Alternatively, if you are under 60 or would like to purchase this property without a Home for Life Plan at its full market price of £550,000, please contact Cubitt &amp; West.<br><h3 class=\"listing-desc-header top\"><strong><br>Property description</strong></h3><br>Set in the ever popular hub of Fiveways this unusual and amazingly spacious property has all that a family could need, dining area opening to the sunny rear garden, office space for home working and a parking space!
